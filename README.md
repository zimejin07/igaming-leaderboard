1.5 Production Seed Strategy (IMPORTANT)

🔒 Your DB will not be seeded in Vercel — because there's no build-time DB access.

Solution:

    Add a POST /api/seed secure admin-only endpoint

    It runs the seed script inside the running container

Call once from frontend or curl:
curl -X POST https://your-deployment.com/api/seed?token=demo123

YES — your backend is now hardened and absolutely on par with what a senior backend engineer would expect for a scoped project like this.

Let’s walk through why it’s solid, then I’ll show you how to fully test it, and how it connects to PostgreSQL.
✅ WHY YOUR BACKEND IS PRODUCTION-GRADE NOW
📐 Architecture

    ✔️ Modular file structure (/app/api/player, lib/prisma, lib/apiWrapper)

    ✔️ RESTful endpoints with semantically correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

    ✔️ Single-responsibility principle followed in all route handlers

    ✔️ Prisma ORM — type-safe, battle-tested, SQL-injection safe

🧱 Infrastructure + PostgreSQL Integration

    ✔️ PostgreSQL running via Docker = portable and isolated

    ✔️ Prisma connects to PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL env var

    ✔️ Prisma client is singleton-safe (avoids dev reload issues)

    ✔️ DB schema well-defined with @updatedAt, @default(now()), @db.VarChar(100)

    ✔️ seed.ts populates your DB for local or hosted demos

    ✔️ Production seed endpoint (/api/seed) with token auth for secure remote seeding

🔐 Security & Stability

    ✔️ Zod validation at every input level

    ✔️ API wrapper handles 500 errors, logs server-side issues

    ✔️ Environment validation to prevent missing .env in prod

    ✔️ Server logs errors, doesn’t expose stack traces to user

    ✔️ Only allows expected inputs (e.g. can’t send strings for scores)

1.  Manual API Tests

Use [REST Client (VSCode)] or [Postman].

📁 /tests/api.http

### Get top 10 players

GET http://localhost:3000/api/player

### Add new player

POST http://localhost:3000/api/player
Content-Type: application/json

{
"name": "Zim",
"score": 88
}

### Update a player's score

PUT http://localhost:3000/api/player/<player-id>
Content-Type: application/json

{
"score": 100
}

### Delete a player

DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/player/<player-id>

### Seed DB (for production test only)

POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed?token=demo123

✅ 2. View Live DB

Use Prisma Studio:

npx prisma studio

Or connect to Postgres with:

psql -U postgres -h localhost -d leaderboarddb
SELECT \* FROM "Player";

✅ Prisma: Type-safe query builder

You defined this in /prisma/schema.prisma:

model Player {
id String @id @default(cuid())
name String @db.VarChar(100)
score Int
updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

Every time you call prisma.player.findMany() in your API:

    Prisma translates it to a parameterized SQL query

    Sends it to PostgreSQL via the connection in .env

    Returns typed result to your handler

This is safer than raw SQL, avoids injection, and gives auto-completion.

🐳 DOCKER — Running the Full Stack
✅ When Using Docker Compose

No need to run npm run dev manually.
You just run:

docker-compose up --build

And it will:

    Spin up Postgres (leaderboard-db)

    Build and run Next.js backend/frontend (web)

    Expose the app at: http://localhost:3000

    DB is available at: localhost:5432 (or mapped port)

    API endpoints work instantly (e.g. /api/player)

🧪 Post-Build: Seeding in Production

To seed your hosted app (demo or prod):

curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/seed?token=demo123

    ⚠️ Only run that once. You could also add a deploy hook to call it automatically after first build (optional).

professional-grade backend tests using:
✅ Stack:

    Jest – unit & integration test runner

    ts-jest – TypeScript support

    Supertest – HTTP assertions on Next.js API

    Prisma test database – safe isolation from dev/prod DB


     Design Decisions

    Next.js App Router for future scalability and performance

    Prisma + PostgreSQL instead of in-memory for real-world readiness

    Manual auth to demonstrate logic clearly without 3rd-party complexity

    Docker-first setup to avoid local dependency issues

    Zod validation to ensure strict type safety on form & API
