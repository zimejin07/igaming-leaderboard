# üéÆ iGaming Leaderboard App

A full-stack application for managing and displaying a real-time leaderboard. Built using Next.js (App Router), PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, and hardened with security, validation, and testing best practices.

---

## Overview

This app allows:

- Public users to view a leaderboard of the top 10 players üèÜ 
- Admins to add, update, or delete players üõ°Ô∏è
- Secure access to protected admin routes
- Real-time auto-refresh using SWR üîÑ 
- Dockerized full-stack deployment with seed control üê≥
- Integration testing using Jest & Supertest üß™

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TailwindCSS, SWR
- **Backend**: REST API, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Docker)
- **Auth**: Token-based middleware
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Docker Compose

---

## Development Strategy

This project followed an agile, single-sprint delivery model with a focus on rapidly releasing a functional MVP. All core features were prioritized and delivered within a single development cycle.

### Release Strategy

- Focused on shipping a fully working full-stack app within one sprint
- Hardened backend and protected admin flows for demo safety
- Leveraged Docker for portability and consistent local setups
- Used seed endpoints to support live demo testing

### Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zimejin07/igaming-leaderboard.git

cd igaming-leaderboard

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start with Docker (PostgreSQL + Web App)
docker-compose up --build

# 4. Visit the app
# Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

# 5. Seed the DB if not auto-seeded
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed?token=demo123
```

## Authentication

Admin Login (hardcoded for demo):

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `demo123`

A valid login sets a token (`demo-token`) in local storage, which is validated by `middleware.ts`.

### Docker Setup

Start Application

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Services started:

- PostgreSQL at `localhost:5432`
- Web app at `http://localhost:3000`

---

### Testing

Run tests locally:

```bash
npm run test
```

or via Docker (using test-runner service):

```bash
docker-compose --profile test run --rm test-runner
```

---

### Tests cover:
